# Monitoring and Observability

Define monitoring strategy optimized for academic environments with educational analytics integration.

## Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Sentry for error tracking with student privacy protection, Web Vitals monitoring for academic device performance
- **Backend Monitoring:** Flask metrics with academic load pattern analysis, PostgreSQL performance monitoring with burst capacity tracking  
- **Error Tracking:** Educational error categorization with learning analytics integration, faculty intervention trigger monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring:** Academic network resilience tracking, calculation engine performance optimization, collaborative session health monitoring
- **Academic Analytics:** Student competency development tracking, faculty intervention effectiveness measurement, institutional adoption and usage patterns

## Key Metrics

**Investment Performance Optimization Metrics:**
- **Real-time sensitivity analysis response time** (<1 second parameter impact feedback via classical ML)
- **LLM API response time** (<2 seconds for strategy recommendations via Anthropic/OpenRouter)
- **AI recommendation accuracy** (>70% improvement rate for strategy suggestions)
- **Competitive ranking accuracy** (100% correct relative positioning within simulation groups)
- **Strategy forecasting precision** (Â±5% accuracy for investment performance predictions via CatBoost/XGBoost)
- **Building block customization success** (User formula adjustments maintain Excel equivalence)
- **API cost efficiency** (<$0.10 per student per analysis session)
- **Local deployment performance** (<10 seconds for Ollama-based recommendations)

**Educational Performance Metrics:**
- Analysis completion time reduction (target: 85% improvement from Excel baseline)
- Constraint violation reduction (target: 90% reduction through real-time validation)
- **Investment performance improvement tracking** (measurable competitive ranking gains)
- Student confidence improvement (measured through learning analytics and satisfaction surveys)
- Faculty adoption rate and sustained usage patterns across different institution types

**Technical Performance Metrics:**
- Real-time collaboration latency (<500ms parameter updates, <2s full calculation refresh)
- **External API integration performance** (<2 seconds Anthropic/OpenRouter, <10 seconds Ollama fallback)
- **Classical ML performance** (<1 second CatBoost/XGBoost parameter sensitivity analysis)
- **API fallback reliability** (>95% uptime with local Ollama deployment backup)
- Academic network resilience (connection recovery time, offline queue processing success)
- Calculation accuracy validation (100% Excel equivalence across all GMC formulas)
- Concurrent user performance (50+ users per simulation group during peak assignment periods)

**Academic Compliance Metrics:**
- FERPA audit trail completeness (100% of student data operations logged with institutional context)
- Academic integrity event detection and resolution effectiveness
- Faculty intervention trigger accuracy and response time
- Cross-institutional data isolation verification and boundary enforcement
- **Competitive intelligence privacy protection** (0% team identity exposure in benchmarking)
- **AI recommendation transparency** (100% explainable optimization suggestions with educational context)
- **API privacy compliance** (0% sensitive student data in external API calls for privacy-sensitive institutions)
- **Local deployment capability** (100% functionality available via Ollama for data residency requirements)
