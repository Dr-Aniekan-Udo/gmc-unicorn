# Alternative Technology Analysis

## Core Technology Decision Justification

### Database Technology Selection

**PostgreSQL for Core Services**
```yaml
Decision: PostgreSQL for gmc-calculation-service, user-management-service, analytics-service
Alternatives Considered:
  MySQL:
    Pros: Wide adoption, simple setup, good performance
    Cons: Limited JSON support, weaker ACID compliance, less advanced features
    Verdict: Rejected - JSON support crucial for GMC report structures
  
  MongoDB:
    Pros: Flexible schema, good for rapid development, native JSON
    Cons: Eventual consistency, complex transactions, learning curve
    Verdict: Rejected - ACID compliance required for financial calculations
    
  SQLite:
    Pros: Simple deployment, no server required, fast for small datasets
    Cons: No concurrent writes, limited scalability, no network access
    Verdict: Rejected - Multi-user concurrent access required

Chosen: PostgreSQL
Rationale:
  - Complex relational data with GMC report interdependencies
  - ACID compliance essential for financial calculations
  - JSON support for nested GMC data structures  
  - Academic environment compatibility (most universities run PostgreSQL)
  - Advanced features: Row-level security, institutional boundaries
  - Concurrent user support with MVCC for 50+ simultaneous users
```

**React.js for Frontend Framework**
```yaml
Decision: React.js 18.2+ with TypeScript for frontend
Alternatives Considered:
  Vue.js:
    Pros: Simpler learning curve, good performance, smaller bundle size
    Cons: Smaller ecosystem, fewer educational resources, less enterprise adoption
    Verdict: Considered - Good alternative but React ecosystem advantages won
    
  Angular:
    Pros: Full framework, excellent TypeScript integration, enterprise features
    Cons: Steep learning curve, heavy framework, over-engineered for educational use
    Verdict: Rejected - Too complex for educational technology context
    
  Svelte:
    Pros: Excellent performance, simple syntax, small bundle sizes
    Cons: Smaller ecosystem, fewer developers, less mature for complex apps
    Verdict: Rejected - Ecosystem maturity concerns for educational deployment

Chosen: React.js 18.2+
Rationale:
  - Component-based architecture ideal for 14+ GMC interface components
  - Excellent TypeScript integration for educational code quality
  - Mature ecosystem with accessibility libraries (Headless UI)
  - Large talent pool in educational technology sector
  - Progressive enhancement patterns support universal access
  - Strong community support for mathematical visualization (Plotly integration)
```

**Flask for Microservices Framework**
```yaml
Decision: Flask for all Python microservices
Alternatives Considered:
  FastAPI:
    Pros: Modern async support, automatic OpenAPI generation, excellent performance
    Cons: Newer framework, smaller ecosystem, async complexity for educational context
    Verdict: Strong consideration - May adopt for performance-critical services
    
  Django:
    Pros: Full framework, admin interface, excellent ORM, security features
    Cons: Heavy framework, monolithic patterns, over-engineered for microservices
    Verdict: Rejected - Too heavy for microservice architecture
    
  Express.js (Node.js):
    Pros: JavaScript ecosystem consistency, good performance, large community
    Cons: Different language stack, less suitable for mathematical processing
    Verdict: Rejected - Python ecosystem better for mathematical/ML requirements

Chosen: Flask
Rationale:
  - Lightweight framework perfect for microservice boundaries
  - Python ecosystem alignment with mathematical processing (NumPy, pandas)
  - Educational simplicity - easy for academic developers to understand
  - Excellent SQLAlchemy integration for multiple database types
  - Strong community support in academic and scientific computing
  - Easy integration with AI/ML libraries (Rasa, spaCy, MLflow)
```
