Date: 2025-08-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2  
- Medium Risks: 2
- Low Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 65/100 (Moderate-High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Microservices Architecture Complexity

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex distributed system with 6+ services, API Gateway routing, multi-database coordination
**Impact**: High (3) - Complete system failure if service communication breaks, development velocity severely impacted
**Mitigation**:
- Start with simplified MVP architecture - implement 2-3 core services first
- Implement circuit breaker patterns using libraries like Hystrix or resilience4j
- Set up comprehensive service monitoring with distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)
- Create service dependency mapping and health dashboard
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical service failures

**Testing Focus**: 
- Service mesh connectivity tests
- Fault injection testing
- Load testing with service failures
- Distributed transaction rollback scenarios

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID   | Category | Title                              | Prob | Impact | Score | Priority |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------|------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001  | Technical| Microservices Architecture Complex | High | High   | 9     | Critical |
| DATA-001  | Data     | Project Data Isolation Failure    | Med  | High   | 6     | High     |
| OPS-001   | Operational| Multi-Database Orchestration     | High | Med    | 6     | High     |
| TECH-002  | Technical| Dependency Management Conflicts    | Med  | Med    | 4     | Medium   |
| PERF-001  | Performance| API Gateway Bottlenecks          | Med  | Med    | 4     | Medium   |
| SEC-001   | Security | Service-to-Service Auth Gaps      | Low  | High   | 3     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Service Communication Tests**: API Gateway routing, service discovery, health checks
- **Failure Resilience Tests**: Service failures, database outages, network partitions
- **Performance Baselines**: Response times under normal and stressed conditions
- **Distributed System Tests**: End-to-end workflows across multiple services

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Project Isolation Tests**: Cross-project data contamination prevention
- **Database Integration Tests**: Multi-database transaction consistency
- **Authentication Flow Tests**: JWT validation across service boundaries

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests
- **Build Integration Tests**: uv + npm dependency resolution
- **Development Environment Tests**: Docker Compose orchestration
- **Configuration Management Tests**: Service configuration propagation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- TECH-001: Microservices complexity must be managed with proper monitoring and graceful degradation
- DATA-001: Project data isolation must be bulletproof with automated validation

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- OPS-001: Multi-database complexity acceptable with proper tooling and monitoring
- SEC-001: Service auth acceptable with current JWT + mTLS implementation

### Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Service Health**: Individual service availability, response times, error rates
- **Database Performance**: Connection pools, query performance, replication lag
- **Project Boundaries**: Automated validation of project data isolation
- **Resource Utilization**: Memory, CPU, storage across all components

## Risk-Based Recommendations

1. **Phased Implementation Strategy**
   - Phase 1: Core services only (calculation, user-management, frontend)
   - Phase 2: Add knowledge-graph and content-management
   - Phase 3: Complete with analytics and notification services

2. **Development Focus**
   - Implement service health checks FIRST before any business logic
   - Create project isolation validation as middleware
   - Set up distributed tracing early in development

3. **Testing Priority**
   - Integration tests are more critical than unit tests for this story
   - Focus on service boundary and data isolation testing
   - Automated testing of project context validation

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Use feature flags for individual services
   - Implement blue-green deployment for critical services
   - Database migration rollback procedures
