# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Transform the intimidating Excel spreadsheet experience into an intuitive, visual dashboard that feels like a modern analytics platform with robust error recovery. The interface should reduce cognitive load through visual metaphors (battery indicators, flow diagrams) while providing immediate feedback for all user actions and clear paths to correct mistakes. Users should feel confident experimenting with parameters knowing they can instantly revert any changes.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Slider-based parameter adjustment** with instant visual feedback and automatic state saving
- **Three-tier constraint validation** with warning tooltips (yellow), caution backgrounds (orange), and blocking alerts (red) with guided resolution steps
- **Analysis History navigation** with timeline scrubber and one-click reversion to any previous state
- **Progressive error prevention** that disables impossible actions rather than allowing violations
- **Contextual help system** with GMC business logic explanations embedded in UI tooltips
- **Interactive Popup/Modal Windows** with full zoom, pan, and drag-to-reposition capabilities for multi-sheet analysis views that overlay current page without navigation

## Core Screens and Views
- **Command Center** (Main Dashboard): All analysis sheets as status cards with traffic light indicators, constraint summary panel, company selection interface, and quick-access history timeline
- **Production Studio** (Cost of Production): Parameter sliders with real-time constraint visualization, "what-if" preview pane, and guided resolution for violations
- **Performance Radar** (Financial Impact): Investment metrics with trend indicators, benchmark comparisons, and impact attribution from parameter changes
- **Guardrails Center** (Constraint Validation): Violations grouped by severity with step-by-step resolution guidance and impact preview
- **Analysis History Panel**: Timeline view of all parameter changes with annotations, quick revert buttons, and scenario comparison tools
- **Data Import Hub**: GMC report upload with validation, automatic sheet population status, company detection, and error correction workflow
- **Company Selection Center**: Interface for choosing team company identity with competitive context display and data validation status

## Error Recovery & State Management
**Analysis History System:**
- **Automatic state snapshots** every 30 seconds and before any major parameter change
- **Visual timeline** showing analysis progression with key decision points highlighted
- **One-click reversion** to any previous state with preview of changes that will be undone
- **Annotated checkpoints** where users can add notes to significant analysis moments
- **Scenario branching** allowing users to create named save points and explore alternatives

**Undo/Redo Implementation:**
- **Granular undo**: Individual parameter changes can be reversed without affecting subsequent unrelated changes
- **Batch undo**: Related changes (e.g., all production parameters for one product) can be undone as a group
- **Smart redo**: After undo, redo stack maintains until new changes are made
- **Visual indicators**: Undo/redo buttons show number of available operations
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y with visual confirmation of actions being reversed

## Data Validation Feedback Patterns
**Three-Tier Validation System:**
1. **Warning Level (Yellow)**: Soft constraints that may impact efficiency but don't break rules
2. **Caution Level (Orange)**: Approaching hard constraints or sub-optimal decisions
3. **Violation Level (Red)**: Hard constraint breaches that prevent submission

## Team Collaboration Support
**Real-Time Collaborative Analysis:**
- **Shared Session Access**: Multiple team members (3-5 typical GMC team size) can simultaneously access the same analysis session
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Parameter changes and calculations update across all team member screens within 2 seconds
- **Conflict Prevention**: Visual indicators show which team member is currently editing specific analysis areas
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Configurable access control allowing team leads to assign specific analysis areas to team members
- **Decision Rationale System**: Integrated commenting and annotation tools for documenting strategic reasoning
- **Change Attribution**: Clear tracking of which team member made specific parameter changes with timestamps
- **Collaborative Export**: Reports include team decision-making process documentation and individual contribution tracking

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Standard web accessibility compliance ensuring keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color-blind friendly indicators for constraint validation systems.

## Branding
Clean, professional interface prioritizing functional clarity over visual sophistication. Neutral base palette (grays, whites) with strategic color coding: green for healthy constraints, yellow for warnings, orange for cautions, red for violations.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Desktop-first design optimized for analytical work requiring multiple simultaneous data views. Responsive breakpoints ensure tablet compatibility for review and presentation scenarios.
