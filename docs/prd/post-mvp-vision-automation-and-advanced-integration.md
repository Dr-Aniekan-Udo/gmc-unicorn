# Post-MVP Vision: Automation and Advanced Integration

## N8n Workflow Automation Use Cases
Following successful MVP deployment, the platform will expand to support advanced automation scenarios:

**Automated Analysis Workflows:**
- **Scheduled Report Processing**: Automatically import and process GMC reports as they become available
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of team performance with automated alerts for significant changes
- **Optimization Recommendations**: AI-driven analysis suggesting parameter adjustments based on historical success patterns

**Integration Scenarios:**
- **Institutional Dashboards**: Aggregate analytics across multiple teams and simulation groups for faculty oversight
- **Cross-Platform Data Exchange**: Integration with university learning management systems and grade books
- **Advanced Reporting**: Automated generation of detailed analysis reports and performance summaries

**API-Driven Capabilities:**
- **Custom Tool Integration**: Third-party tools can access GMC analysis data through standardized OpenAPI endpoints  
- **Bulk Analysis Processing**: Batch processing capabilities for analyzing multiple scenarios simultaneously
- **Real-Time Data Feeds**: Live performance monitoring and constraint validation for external systems

## Technical Architecture Evolution
The modular monolithic foundation enables seamless evolution to support automation without architectural rewrites, maintaining the MVP's simplicity while providing enterprise-grade extensibility for advanced users.
