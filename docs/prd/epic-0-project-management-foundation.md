# Epic 0: Project Management Foundation

**Epic Goal:** Create the comprehensive project management system that serves as the foundation for all GMC analysis activities, enabling users to create multiple independent analysis projects, experiment with different strategies for the same or different games, and maintain complete isolation between project contexts while supporting real-time team collaboration within each project scope.

## Story 0.1: Project Creation and Management System

**As a** GMC participant,  
**I want** to create and manage multiple named analysis projects,  
**so that** I can experiment with different strategic approaches and maintain separate analysis contexts for different games or strategies.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Project creation interface allows users to create new projects with custom names (duplicates allowed for strategy experimentation)
2. Project list interface displays all projects accessible to the user with creation date, last modified, and team member indicators
3. Project switching functionality allows seamless navigation between different projects with complete context isolation
4. Project deletion with confirmation safeguards and data archival options for completed analysis projects
5. Project duplication feature allows users to clone existing projects as starting points for alternative strategies
6. Project metadata tracking includes creation timestamp, last accessed, modification history, and team member activity logs

## Story 0.2: Project-Scoped File Management and Timeline Independence

**As a** GMC participant,  
**I want** completely independent file management for each project,  
**so that** I can upload different historical data sets and maintain separate timelines for different strategic experiments.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Project-specific file upload interface isolates all historical data and reports within project boundaries
2. Each project maintains independent timeline management with drag-and-drop reordering specific to that project context
3. File naming recognition (Hst, W prefixes) operates independently within each project without cross-project interference
4. Project file validation ensures completeness within project scope and provides project-specific warnings for data gaps
5. Historical timeline visualization per project with project-specific chronological organization and trend analysis
6. Project file replacement and removal capabilities with project-scoped impact analysis and recalculation triggers

## Story 0.3: Real-Time Team Collaboration Across Multiple Projects

**As a** team member,  
**I want** seamless collaboration across multiple concurrent projects,  
**so that** my team can work together on different strategic approaches simultaneously with complete transparency.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Any team member can create projects visible to all other team members with immediate access and modification rights
2. Real-time synchronization of project changes across all team member sessions within 2 seconds per project
3. Project-specific change attribution tracking shows which team member made modifications in which project context
4. Visual indicators display active team member presence per project with color-coded editing status
5. Project activity dashboard shows team member engagement across all projects with recent activity summaries
6. Conflict resolution handles simultaneous edits within project boundaries without affecting other project contexts

## Story 0.4: Project-Scoped Analysis Context and State Management

**As a** GMC participant,  
**I want** complete analysis isolation between projects,  
**so that** calculations, decisions, and states in one project never interfere with analysis in other projects.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All calculation engines operate within project boundaries with complete data isolation between projects
2. Project-specific undo/redo functionality maintains state history independently for each project context
3. Decision parameters, constraint validations, and performance calculations remain completely isolated per project
4. Project switching preserves exact analysis state and resumes where analysis was left off in each project
5. Cross-project contamination prevention ensures no data or state leakage between different project contexts
6. Project-scoped session management maintains separate user preferences and interface configurations per project

## Story 0.5: Project-Specific Competitive Intelligence and Strategy Tracking

**As a** GMC participant,  
**I want** independent competitive tracking for each project,  
**so that** I can analyze different competitive strategies and track competitor patterns specific to each strategic approach.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Project-scoped competitor analysis maintains separate competitive intelligence data for each project context
2. Performance trend analysis operates independently per project using project-specific historical data and competitor information
3. Strategic pattern recognition analyzes competitor behavior within each project's data context without cross-project influence
4. Group information extraction from uploaded files provides project-specific competitive insights based on project's historical timeline
5. Trend prediction algorithms operate on project-specific data to provide targeted strategic recommendations per project approach
6. Competitor ranking and progression tracking maintains independent metrics per project for accurate strategy comparison

## Story 0.6: Repository Initialization and Development Environment Workflow

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a complete repository setup and development environment initialization process,  
**so that** new team members can quickly establish a working development environment with all required dependencies and configurations.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Repository initialization script creates proper Git structure with initial commit and branch protection rules
2. Comprehensive .gitignore generation with Python (uv), Node.js (npm), database files, IDE configs, OS files, and `.ignore/` folder excluded from GitHub
3. Manual GitHub connection workflow - initialize local git, then prompt user to connect their GitHub profile for code push, issues, and GitHub operations
4. Development environment setup guide includes uv installation, npm configuration, and Python 3.12 virtual environment creation
5. Initial README generation with project overview, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines
6. Development dependencies installation verification with health-check validation for all microservices
7. Local development configuration templates for database connections, API keys, and service endpoints
8. Pre-commit hooks installation for code quality, security scanning, and formatting consistency

## Story 0.7: Multi-Provider AI Service Integration with API-Key-Only Authentication

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** comprehensive multi-provider AI service integration using API-key-only authentication,  
**so that** users can seamlessly connect to any AI platform without username requirements and with intelligent provider selection.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. OpenRouter as Primary Service - Multi-model routing with comprehensive model selection capabilities
2. External service account creation checklist for all 6 AI providers: OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, and cloud providers
