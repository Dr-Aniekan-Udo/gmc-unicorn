# Epic 5: Project-Managed Interactive Dashboard & User Experience Excellence

**Epic Goal:** Create comprehensive project management dashboards with intuitive project navigation, advanced visual analytics per project, project-scoped undo/redo functionality, and guided analysis workflows that transform complex GMC multi-project analysis into an engaging, efficient user experience enabling strategic experimentation across multiple projects while reducing per-project analysis time from 4 hours to 45 minutes.

## Story 5.1: Project Management Command Center Dashboard Interface

**As a** user,  
**I want** a centralized project management command center that provides overview of all projects and their analysis components,  
**so that** I can efficiently switch between projects, monitor multiple project statuses, and navigate analysis areas within each project context.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Project Overview Panel**: Main dashboard displays all user projects with summary cards showing project status, last accessed, and key metrics
2. **Project Switcher**: Quick project navigation system allows seamless switching between projects with complete context preservation per project
3. **Project-Specific Analysis Dashboard**: Within each project, displays analysis sheets as interactive cards with traffic light status indicators for that project only
4. **Project-Scoped KPIs**: Key performance indicators display current investment performance and metrics specific to the active project context
5. **Project Activity Feeds**: Recent activity shows latest parameter changes and impacts within the current project, isolated from other project activities
6. **Multi-Project Status Monitoring**: Overall view allows monitoring health indicators across all projects while maintaining project-specific detail views

## Story 5.2: Advanced Visual Analytics System

**As a** user,  
**I want** sophisticated data visualization that makes complex relationships immediately understandable,  
**so that** I can quickly grasp the implications of my decisions without studying detailed numbers.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Interactive charts and graphs display key relationships between decisions and outcomes
2. Constraint visualization system uses intuitive "battery indicators" and capacity gauges
3. Performance trend analysis shows historical progression with clear impact attribution
4. Decision impact visualization highlights which parameters drive largest performance changes
5. Cross-sheet dependency visualization helps users understand complex calculation relationships
6. Real-time chart updates reflect parameter changes with smooth animations and clear feedback

## Story 5.3: Complete Undo/Redo and State Management

**As a** user,  
**I want** comprehensive undo/redo functionality with intelligent state management,  
**so that** I can confidently experiment with different parameters without fear of losing progress.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Granular undo/redo supports individual parameter changes without affecting unrelated decisions
2. Batch undo/redo handles related parameter groups (e.g., all pricing decisions) as logical units
3. Visual timeline interface shows analysis progression with key decision points highlighted
4. Automatic checkpoint creation saves state before major parameter changes or analysis phases
5. Smart redo stack maintains after undo operations until new changes invalidate forward history
6. State annotation system allows users to add notes explaining reasoning for major decisions

## Story 5.4: Guided Analysis Workflow System

**As a** user,  
**I want** intelligent workflow guidance that helps me complete analysis efficiently,  
**so that** I can achieve comprehensive analysis in the target 45-minute timeframe.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Progressive disclosure system introduces complexity gradually based on user experience level
2. Guided workflow suggests logical analysis progression from basic decisions to advanced optimization
3. Completion indicators show progress through different analysis phases with remaining tasks
4. Contextual help system provides relevant guidance based on current analysis focus
5. Intelligent recommendations suggest next steps based on current decisions and constraint status
6. Workflow customization allows experienced users to bypass introductory guidance

## Story 5.5: Real-Time Team Collaboration System

**As a** team member,  
**I want** real-time collaboration features that support simultaneous GMC analysis work,  
**so that** my team can work together efficiently without conflicts or coordination overhead.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Shared session access allows 3-5 team members to simultaneously access the same analysis with unique user identification
2. Real-time synchronization updates parameter changes and calculations across all team member screens within 2 seconds
3. Visual conflict prevention shows which team member is actively editing specific analysis areas with colored indicators
4. Role-based permission system allows team leads to assign and control access to specific analysis components
5. Integrated communication tools provide in-context commenting and decision rationale capture with threaded discussions
6. Change attribution system tracks all parameter modifications with team member identification and timestamps

## Story 5.6: Error Recovery and Data Resilience

**As a** user,  
**I want** robust error handling and data recovery capabilities,  
**so that** technical issues don't disrupt my analysis work or cause data loss.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Automatic file format detection handles different GMC report versions and provides specific error messages for unsupported formats
2. Data recovery mechanisms automatically restore analysis sessions from backup points when system failures occur
3. Graceful error handling prevents application crashes when Excel files contain missing sheets or corrupted data
4. Comprehensive validation reporting provides detailed logs for troubleshooting file upload and processing issues
5. Session persistence maintains analysis state during network interruptions with automatic reconnection and synchronization
6. Offline mode capabilities allow continued analysis work with local data storage and sync when connectivity is restored

## Story 5.7: Competitive Benchmarking and Analytics

**As a** user,  
**I want** performance benchmarking capabilities that provide competitive context,  
**so that** I can understand how my team's strategies compare to others and identify improvement opportunities.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Anonymous benchmarking displays team performance relative to simulation group averages without revealing individual team identities
2. Relative performance indicators show clear visualization of team ranking and performance gaps within competitive context
3. Performance distribution analytics help teams understand their position within class performance ranges and historical benchmarks
4. Best practice insights highlight successful strategies from high-performing teams (with instructor approval and anonymization)
5. Trend comparison capabilities show how team improvement rates compare to simulation group progression patterns
6. Competitive context integration enhances scenario analysis by showing how different strategies perform relative to group benchmarks

## Story 5.8: Mobile and Accessibility Excellence

**As a** user with diverse access needs,  
**I want** excellent accessibility and mobile compatibility,  
**so that** I can access analysis capabilities regardless of device or accessibility requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Full WCAG AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
2. High contrast mode and color-blind friendly design for constraint validation indicators
3. Responsive design provides meaningful mobile experience for review and presentation scenarios
4. Touch-optimized controls work effectively on tablet devices for collaborative review sessions
5. Offline capability allows analysis continuation when internet connectivity is unreliable
6. Multi-language support accommodates global GMC participant community
