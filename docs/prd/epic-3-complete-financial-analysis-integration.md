2. Receipts calculation matrix (K12:T25) forecasts revenue collection timing based on sales and credit terms
3. Balance sheet integration (A1:C25) maintains asset structure with proper receivables aging
4. Cash flow integration (E1:H25) schedules revenue realization with appropriate collection delays
5. Credit risk validation warns of over-extension in specific markets or customer segments
6. Revenue timing optimization suggests credit term adjustments to improve cash flow

## Story 3.3: Complete Investment Performance System

**As a** user,  
**I want** the complete investment performance calculation system,  
**so that** I can evaluate my overall strategic effectiveness using GMC's ultimate success metric.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Share capital management (E3:E6) processes all equity transactions with proper accounting
2. Market valuation calculations (I4:T4) compare performance against competitor benchmarks
3. Multi-year performance tracking (M12:O16) maintains historical context for trend analysis
4. Quarterly progression analysis (D20:H31) tracks share price evolution and valuation changes
5. Investment performance metric (I9) provides real-time ultimate success measurement
6. Performance attribution analysis shows which decision categories most impact final results

## Story 3.4: Hired Transport Optimization

**As a** user,  
**I want** intelligent transport route optimization and cost analysis,  
**so that** I can minimize logistics costs while meeting delivery commitments.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Transport route logic (A2:H7) processes Factory→Agents→Ports→Distributors flow optimization
2. Container capacity optimization (A14:F17) maximizes space utilization across product mix
3. Cost calculation engine (A25:X42) computes optimal routing based on journey length, time, and costs
4. Distribution parameters (K1:X20) enforce capacity and timing constraints for realistic planning
5. Multi-route comparison shows cost-benefit analysis of different shipping strategies
6. Integration with quantity decisions ensures transport capacity matches delivery commitments

## Story 3.5: Shares & Dividend Analysis

**As a** user,  
**I want** comprehensive equity management and dividend policy analysis,  
**so that** I can optimize shareholder value while maintaining financial flexibility.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Investment performance formula implementation (E3:J5) processes core valuation calculations
2. Share price determinant analysis (A8:O26) explains factors driving valuation changes
3. Net worth dependency management (A28:J32) tracks variable relationships affecting equity value
4. Historical transaction processing (A34:J42) maintains complete equity transaction history
5. Dividend policy optimization suggests optimal payout ratios based on cash flow and growth needs
6. Shareholder value analysis shows impact of different equity strategies on long-term performance

## Story 3.6: Cross-Sheet Dependency Engine

**As a** system architect,  
**I want** complete dependency management across all financial analysis components,  
**so that** parameter changes propagate correctly through the entire financial system.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dependency graph implementation manages calculation order across all integrated financial sheets
2. Event propagation system ensures changes in one area trigger appropriate updates in dependent calculations
3. Circular dependency detection prevents infinite calculation loops with proper error handling
4. Performance optimization minimizes calculation overhead while maintaining real-time responsiveness
5. Validation system ensures mathematical consistency across all cross-sheet dependencies
6. Debug capabilities allow developers to trace calculation propagation for troubleshooting
