# Epic 7: Educational Analytics & Faculty Tools

**Epic Goal:** Empower instructors with a comprehensive suite of analytics tools to monitor student performance, track competency development, and provide targeted support, transforming the GMC Dashboard into a powerful pedagogical platform.

## Story 7.1: Faculty Dashboard Implementation

**As an** instructor,
**I want** a centralized dashboard to view class-wide performance, individual student progress, and key learning metrics,
**so that** I can effectively monitor my students' engagement and understanding of the GMC simulation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  Secure, role-based access for faculty members.
2.  Class overview displaying aggregate performance metrics, a distribution of investment performance, and common mistakes.
3.  Drill-down capability from class view to individual student/team dashboards.
4.  Alert system for students who are falling behind or struggling with key concepts.

## Story 7.2: Student Competency Tracking System

**As an** instructor,
**I want** to track the development of specific business competencies for each student,
**so that** I can assess learning outcomes beyond just the final investment performance.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  Framework to define and tag key competencies (e.g., "Financial Analysis," "Market Strategy," "Risk Management").
2.  System to associate student decisions and actions with these competencies.
3.  Visualization of competency development over the course of the simulation.
4.  Reporting feature to show which students are excelling or struggling in specific competency areas.

## Story 7.3: Adaptive Learning & Targeted Recommendations

**As a** student,
**I want** the system to provide personalized recommendations and learning resources based on my performance,
**so that** I can focus on my specific areas of weakness and improve more effectively.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  The system identifies patterns in a student's mistakes or suboptimal decisions.
2.  Provides targeted pop-ups with links to relevant sections of the GMC Manual or other learning resources.
3.  Suggests specific "practice scenarios" to help a student work on a weak area.
4.  Peer learning feature that (anonymously) suggests collaborating with students who are strong in an area where another is weak.
