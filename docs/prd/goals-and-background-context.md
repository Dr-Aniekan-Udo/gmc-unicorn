# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Transform GMC analysis from a 3-4 hour manual Excel exercise into a 15-30 minute guided optimization experience
- Reduce constraint violations by 90% through real-time validation and visual "battery indicators" 
- Improve strategic thinking time ratio from 40% to 80% of total analysis effort
- Achieve 25% market penetration (125+ business schools) within 18 months
- Deliver modular architecture that enables expansion from production analysis to full GMC strategic planning

## Background Context
The GMC Dashboard addresses a critical pedagogical bottleneck where 150,000+ student hours annually are consumed by Excel mechanics rather than strategic learning. Current Excel-based analysis creates artificial barriers with hidden interdependencies, constraint blindness, and multi-quarter complexity that transforms GMC from strategic simulation into spreadsheet proficiency test. The solution leverages comprehensive GMC reference materials and the existing `gmc_analysis.xlsx` formula architecture to create an intuitive web application that maintains educational transparency while dramatically reducing time-to-insight.
