5. Decision impact analysis shows which parameter changes drive the largest performance differences
6. Scenario export functionality generates reports comparing different strategic approaches

## Story 4.4: Cross-Quarter Trend Analysis System

**As a** user,  
**I want** comprehensive trend analysis that combines data from different quarters and sources,  
**so that** I can identify performance patterns and strategic insights across my entire GMC timeline.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Cross-quarter metric tracking combines similar data points from history files and gameplay reports into cohesive trend lines
2. Multi-dimensional trend visualization displays financial, operational, and strategic performance evolution across available quarters
3. Historical baseline calculations provide context for current performance using average/median from available history data
4. Quarter-over-quarter progression analysis highlights improvement or decline patterns with statistical significance indicators
5. Comparative benchmarking shows performance gaps between historical periods and current decisions with actionable insights
6. Trend projection capabilities provide predictive analysis based on historical patterns with confidence intervals

## Story 4.5: Advanced Analytics and Insights

**As a** user,  
**I want** intelligent insights and recommendations based on analysis patterns,  
**so that** I can identify optimization opportunities I might otherwise miss.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Sensitivity analysis identifies which parameters have the greatest impact on investment performance across historical context
2. Optimization suggestions recommend parameter adjustments based on successful historical strategies and current constraints
3. Risk analysis highlights decisions with high uncertainty or potential for negative outcomes using historical volatility data
4. Performance attribution explains which decision categories contribute most to success/failure across quarters
5. Pattern recognition identifies recurring trends and anomalies across quarters for strategic insight generation
6. Interactive guidance system provides contextual help for complex decision interdependencies with historical precedent examples

## Story 4.6: Professional Reporting and Export System

**As a** user,  
**I want** comprehensive reporting capabilities with multiple export formats,
