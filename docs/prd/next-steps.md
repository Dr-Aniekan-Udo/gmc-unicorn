# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
Please review the completed GMC Dashboard PRD and create a comprehensive UX architecture that transforms the documented Excel analysis sheets into an intuitive, modern web interface. Focus on visual hierarchy, constraint validation patterns, and workflow optimization that reduces analysis time from 4 hours to 45 minutes while maintaining analytical depth.

## Architect Prompt  
Using this PRD as your foundation, please design the complete technical architecture for the GMC Dashboard application. Pay special attention to the openpyxl integration requirements, formula dependency management, real-time calculation engine, individual user API key management with PostgreSQL encryption, intelligence directory infrastructure, NoSQL database integration for GMC Manual knowledge base storage, knowledge graph + RAG system architecture with vector database (Weaviate) and graph database (Neo4j), intelligent LLM orchestration of classical models (CatBoost/XGBoost), unified data pipeline for AI training and monitoring, persistent user-specific AI coaching instances with conversational chatbot interface (Rasa), AI assistant task delegation capabilities, comprehensive user data integration for personalized recommendations, and the modular structure that supports future expansion from production analysis to full GMC strategic planning with personalized AI coaching capabilities.
